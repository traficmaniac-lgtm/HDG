# REPORT

- 0.7.29.2: Filter reconcile trades to the active cycle, gate watchdog on ENTRY, relax HTTP entry freshness, add TP maker/cross logs, and rate-limit WS summaries.
- 0.7.29.3: Deterministic ENTRY follow-top plus strict 2-phase EXIT (maker→cross), watchdog only for real stalls.
- 0.7.29.7: Hardened reconcile/recover against phantom fills, enforced entry reprice cooldown/min-tick gating, added explicit ENTRY/EXIT markers, and expanded invariant tests + checklist.
- 0.7.29.8: Fix freeze-after-start: data_blind semantics + entry deadlines + progress watchdog.
- 0.7.29.9: Fixed UI freeze via buffered log flush + throttled noisy logs.
- 0.7.30.0: Added dual start buttons (LONG/SHORT). Shared settings. LONG unchanged.
- 0.7.30.1: UI log is event-only, debug spam moved to file, buffered flush.
- 0.7.30.2: Fix cross-close pricing, isolate timers, recover respects active exit. Reduce emergency market losses.
- 0.7.30.3: Fix FSM deadlock: real progress only, hard deadlines, stop interrupt.
- 0.7.30.4: Order role registry (ENTRY/EXIT_TP/EXIT_CROSS), corrected data_blind/effective_source selection with fresh HTTP, progress watchdog recovery for entry/exit stalls, per-session log files, and UI log throttling refinements.
  - Tests:
    - test_short_buy_fill_is_exit_not_entry
    - test_data_blind_false_when_http_fresh
    - test_fsm_no_stuck_entry_working
- 0.7.30.5: Fixed cache-aware data_blind gating, raised ENTRY freshness window, and added dust accumulate flow for minNotional partial fills.
- 0.7.30.7: Carry dust tails instead of TOPUP spam, enforce single-flight START, correct SHORT entry/exit sides/logs, and base TP/SL triggers + maker prices on book quotes.
- 0.7.30.8: Stop order spam: guard against duplicate place when active order exists.
- 0.7.30.9: Reset wait timers on place/reprice; prevent instant timeouts.
- 0.7.30.10: Fix SHORT semantics (SELL entry / BUY cover exit) + direction-aware tags.
- 0.7.30.11: TP/SL by bid/ask + maker pricing by book; prevent premature CROSS.
- 0.7.30.12: Added trade ledger cycles with realized/unrealized PnL separation, GUI trades table by cycle, and winrate/session stats from closed cycles only.
